# BalancedParentheses
Determine if a string has balanced parentheses. Write a program BalancedParentheses in Java that reads in a text stream      from standard input and uses a stack to determine whether its parentheses      are properly balanced. For example, your program should print true for      [()]{}[{[()()]()}] and false for {[(])}.
